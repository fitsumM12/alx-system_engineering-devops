# What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

Reviewing and encapsulating networking knowledge and skills I had been learning
and practicing over the last month, in this project, I wrote a blog post
answering the classic interview question - what happens when you enter [generic
website] into a browser and hit `Enter`?

  + **INFO**:
    + This question is a classic and still widely used interview question for many types of software engineering position. It is used to assess a candidate's general knowledge of how the web stack works on top of the internet. One important guideline to begin answering this question is that you should ask your interviewer whether they would like you to focus in on one specific area of the workflow. For a front-end position they may want you to talk at length about how the DOM is rendering. For an SRE position they may want you to go into the load balancing mechanism.
    + This question is a good test of whether you understand DNS. Many software engineering candidates struggle with this concept, so if you do well on this question, you are already way ahead of the curve. If you take this project seriously and write an excellent article, it may be something that will grab the attention of future employers.
